# ARIMA Modelling and NASA: Arctic Sea Ice Extent

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis and forecasting project using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models on NASAâ€™s Arctic sea ice extent data. The goal is to predict future changes in the Arctic sea ice extent based on past observations, and to understand the potential environmental impacts. This project highlights key aspects of time series analysis, including identifying trends, seasonality, and the behavior of stochastic processes.

### Key Learnings

1. **Time Series Fundamentals**:
   - Gained a solid understanding of time series components: trend, seasonality, autocorrelation, and stationarity.
   - Differentiated between deterministic and stochastic processes, which are key to building predictive models.
   
2. **Stationarity and Transformations**:
   - Applied techniques such as differencing, logarithmic transformations, and Box-Cox transformations to convert the time series data into a stationary form, making it suitable for ARIMA modeling.
   
3. **ARIMA Models**:
   - Explored and built multiple ARIMA models (e.g., ARIMA(0,1,2), ARIMA(4,1,1)) based on the analysis of ACF and PACF plots.
   - Used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the best model.
   
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Applied residual analysis to evaluate the ARIMA models. Selected ARIMA(4,1,1) as the best model for forecasting Arctic sea ice extent, which captured the trend and variation effectively.
   
5. **Forecasting and Environmental Impact**:
   - Generated forecasts from the best ARIMA model, predicting a significant decline in Arctic sea ice extent over the next decade.
   - These forecasts raise concerns about the potential impacts of declining Arctic sea ice on global climate, sea levels, and ecosystems.

### Applications and Future Use

This project has strengthened my expertise in time series modeling and will allow me to:
- **Climate Change Modeling**: Contribute to environmental and climate research by building predictive models for time-sensitive data like sea ice extent, temperature fluctuations, or greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Financial or Economic Forecasting**: Utilize ARIMA models for predicting stock prices, commodity trends, or economic indicators.
- **Data Science Projects**: Apply advanced time series techniques for forecasting in fields such as IoT, sales, demand prediction, or any area requiring historical data-based predictions.

### How to Use

1. **Requirements**:
   - R programming language
   - `TSA`, `forecast` packages for time series analysis
   - Additional R libraries as specified in the code
